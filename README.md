# HPCC NS-3 simulator
This is an NS-3 simulator for [HPCC: High Precision Congestion Control (SIGCOMM' 2019)](https://rmiao.github.io/publications/hpcc-li.pdf). It also includes the implementation of DCQCN, TIMELY, DCTCP, PFC, ECN and Broadcom shared buffer switch.

We have update this simulator to support HPCC-PINT, which reduces the INT header overhead to just 1 byte. This improves the long flow completion time. See [PINT: Probabilistic In-band Network Telemetry (SIGCOMM' 2020)](https://liyuliang001.github.io/publications/pint.pdf).

It is based on NS-3 version 3.17.

## Quick Start

### Build
`./waf configure`

Please note if gcc version > 5, compilation will fail due to some ns3 code style.  If this what you encounter, please use:

`CC='gcc-5' CXX='g++-5' ./waf configure`

### Experiment config
Please see `mix/config.txt` for example. 

`mix/config_doc.txt` is a explanation of the example (texts in {..} are explanations).

### Run
The direct command to run is:
`./waf --run 'scratch/third mix/config.txt'`

We provide a `run.py` for automatically *generating config* and *running experiment*. Please `python run.py -h` for usage.
Example usage:
`python run.py --cc hp --trace flow --bw 100 --topo topology --hpai 50`

To run HPCC-PINT, try:
`python run.py --cc hpccPint --trace flow --bw 100 --topo topology --hpai 50 --pint_log_base 1.05 --pint_prob 1`
